Sustainability at Partners Group
Sustainability is fully integrated into the investment lifecycle from sourcing to exit. The firm emphasizes active ownership and transformational growth. Sustainability performance is tracked through KPIs using a digital tool called PG Alpha and is monitored through board-level engagement, regular reviews, and assurance. Investment decisions consider both financial and non-financial material factors. Initiatives in portfolio companies include climate risk management, cyber-security, supply chain due diligence, diversity, health and safety, among others.
Material Topics   Double Materiality Assessment (DMA)
Material topics identified for both the firm and its portfolio include environmental concerns like climate change; social topics such as human rights, working conditions, health and safety, talent attraction and retention, and diversity and inclusion; and governance topics including good governance, risk management, responsible investing, corruption and bribery, legal and regulatory compliance, and data and cyber security.
Governance and Management of Sustainability
There is no standalone sustainability committee as sustainability is embedded across all management and governing bodies. The Board of Directors holds ultimate accountability, with oversight by the Executive Team, Risk   Audit Committee, Sustainability Team, and Sustainability Champions in business units. Executive incentives are linked 20  to sustainability performance, forming part of a qualitative metric which constitutes 50  of the long-term incentive formula.
Portfolio Integration
All asset classes and investment types have tailored approaches for integrating sustainability. Controlled investments with more than 50  ownership benefit from strong governance, board oversight, and direct ESG engagement. Non-controlled investments rely on engagement, data collection, and collaborative value creation.
