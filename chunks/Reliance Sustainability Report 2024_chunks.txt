Chunk 1:
This is RIL s first Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), prepared in accordance with SEBI s mandated framework and aligned with India s National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC). The report covers only RIL s standalone operations for the financial year from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023. Its primary purpose is to provide transparent disclosures on the company s environmental, social, and governance performance to a wide range of stakeholders.
RIL s vision focuses on building a connected, prosperous, equitable, and sustainable future. The company outlines its strategic priorities through its key businesses: Oil to Chemicals (O2C), Oil and Gas, Retail, Digital Services, and New Energy. A significant focus has been placed on driving India s transition to a low-carbon economy through investments in green energy infrastructure, including solar, wind, and hydrogen.
The company s governance structure is committed to ethical conduct, board diversity, stakeholder engagement, and sustainability oversight. The board has constituted a dedicated ESG and CSR committee to ensure integration of sustainable practices at the highest levels.
In terms of climate action, RIL has committed to becoming net carbon zero by 2035. The company is investing heavily in renewable energy solutions and circular economy initiatives. It also continues to improve its water and waste management systems across sites, with several zero-liquid discharge sites already operational.
Social performance is a major highlight of the report. RIL reports employment of over 62,000 people in its standalone operations, with a strong emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion. It has implemented numerous community development programs in areas such as education, healthcare, women empowerment, and rural transformation, reaching millions of beneficiaries across India.
On supply chain responsibility, RIL enforces stringent sustainability and human rights practices across its vendor network. Risk assessments and supplier audits are periodically conducted to maintain compliance and promote ethical conduct.
This BRSR demonstrates Reliance s comprehensive ESG framework and its commitment to transparent, responsible growth that aligns with national and global sustainability priorities.
