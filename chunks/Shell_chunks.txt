Chunk 1:
The Shell Sustainability Report 2023 demonstrates Shell s deep integration of sustainability across its core business strategy as the company works toward its ambitious goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Throughout 2023, Shell made substantial progress in reducing emissions from its own operations, achieving a 31  reduction compared to 2016 levels. This represents over 60  completion of its near-term goal to halve emissions by 2030. Supporting these outcomes, Shell significantly increased its investments in low-carbon energy and related technologies, dedicating approximately one-third of its total capital expenditure to areas including biofuels, hydrogen, renewable electricity generation, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and carbon capture and storage technologies.
Safety continues to be of paramount importance to Shell. The company pursues a zero-harm objective for employees and contractors, promoting a strong safety culture through ongoing risk management, contractor safety leadership programs, and proactive incident prevention. Despite regrettable contractor fatalities resulting from accidents and regional security challenges, Shell maintained record-low process safety incidents in 2023 and continues to strengthen transportation safety measures across all travel modes including road, sea, and air.
Shell s approach to climate change is comprehensive, addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by the global energy transition. Committed to the Paris Agreement s goals, Shell uses its proprietary Net Carbon Intensity metric to measure greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy sold, targeting a 15 to 20 percent reduction by 2030. The company s pathway to net-zero combines reducing operational emissions, enabling customers to switch to lower-carbon fuels, significant investment in renewables and cleaner energy technologies, and leveraging carbon credits and offsets. Strong methane emission controls are in place, with Shell maintaining methane leak rates below 0.2  supported by membership in the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership. Routine flaring elimination is progressing ahead of the global 2025 deadline, reflecting Shell s commitment to operational emissions reductions.
On the investment side, Shell has expanded its portfolio of renewable energy projects with several large-scale offshore and onshore wind farms, as well as solar power installations across multiple countries. The company grew its electric vehicle charging network considerably in 2023, adding tens of thousands of new charge points globally and acquiring businesses to enhance its market presence. Biofuel production has likewise increased, focusing on advanced biofuels based on sustainable, non-food feedstocks such as agricultural residues and agroforestry byproducts. Shell promotes the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels and renewable natural gas as critical components in decarbonizing mobility sectors that are harder to electrify.
Nature conservation and biodiversity protection are integrated into Shell s operational planning and environmental management practices. The company adheres to strict policies to avoid exploration in protected areas including UNESCO World Heritage sites and applies a mitigation hierarchy aiming to avoid, minimize, or offset impacts on biodiversity. Shell participates actively in global biodiversity initiatives such as the Kunming-Montreal Framework and the Science Based Targets Network and promotes Indigenous Peoples  rights through respectful engagement, including Free, Prior and Informed Consent and equitable benefit-sharing agreements. Cultural heritage preservation is a fundamental consideration in project development and community interaction.
Water stewardship is a focused priority, especially in water-stressed regions. Shell has reduced freshwater consumption in critical areas, implemented stringent wastewater treatment and discharge controls, and encourages sustainable water use across its operations and supply chains. Circular economy initiatives target waste minimization, increased recycling, and reuse in manufacturing and chemical production processes. Despite challenges in acquiring sufficient recycled plastics feedstock, Shell is pioneering advancements in circular chemistry through pilot projects such as pyrolysis and mechanical recycling technologies, working alongside partners to strengthen supply chain circularity.
Social sustainability features prominently in Shell s community engagement, with investments in education, workforce skills development, entrepreneurship, and energy access programs aimed at underserved populations. Youth-focused initiatives equip future generations for careers in evolving energy sectors. Workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion remain central commitments. In 2023, women accounted for 42 percent of the Board of Directors and 43 percent of Executive Committee positions. Shell promotes ethnic diversity, LGBTQ  inclusion, support for persons with disabilities, and psychological safety at work, fostering an inclusive and respectful workplace culture. Employee wellbeing and engagement are actively supported through comprehensive mental health programs, safety initiatives, and continuous learning opportunities.
In supply chain management, Shell requires suppliers to adhere to strict environmental standards, labor rights protections, and ethical business practices. The company supports local suppliers, particularly in low-income countries, and monitors contractor welfare rigorously through audits and grievance mechanisms. Transparency and accountability are facilitated by confidential reporting channels allowing stakeholders to raise concerns safely.
Governance frameworks and reporting practices align with leading sustainability standards and frameworks including Ipieca, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Shell obtains independent external assurance of critical greenhouse gas emission metrics and related key performance indicators, bolstering credibility and fostering stakeholder trust. The company actively participates in policy dialogue, regulatory development, and industry coalitions aimed at advancing an enabling environment for global energy transition goals.
Overall, the Shell Sustainability Report 2023 illustrates a comprehensive, integrated approach to managing environmental, social, and governance challenges while progressing toward a sustainable, low-carbon energy future. The report showcases Shell s significant advances in emissions reduction, renewable energy deployment, biodiversity stewardship, responsible supply chain management, and social inclusion alongside maintaining operational safety and reliability. Shell s strategy embodies a balanced, forward-looking alignment of financial performance, environmental stewardship, and social responsibility that aims to meet the evolving expectations of its stakeholders and society at large.
