Chunk 1:
Nestlé s Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2023 outlines the company s strategic focus on advancing regenerative food systems to address climate change, improve livelihoods, and enhance environmental stewardship. The company has made important progress toward its science-based Net Zero targets, achieving a 13.58  net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions versus the 2018 baseline by the end of 2023. This progress is supported by efforts to reduce emissions across all scopes, with a particular emphasis on agriculture, which accounts for a significant portion of the footprint. Dairy remains the largest emission source within the supply chain, and Nestlé continues to innovate and collaborate with farmers to reduce methane and other emissions.
The report emphasizes the expansion of income accelerator programs to support cocoa-farming families, aiming to reach 160,000 families by 2030, alongside efforts to close the living income gap and combat child labor. Nutrition is another core ambition, with a target to grow sales of nutritious products by CHF 20 to 25 billion by 2030. Nestlé is actively reformulating product recipes to reduce sugars, salt, and saturated fats and investing in affordable nutrition and plant-based diets to improve health outcomes globally. The  Good for You  nutrition strategy was launched in 2023 to make balanced diets accessible to billions by enhancing portfolio nutrition and consumer education.
Governance around environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics is robust, with oversight by the Board of Directors and Sustainability Committee, supported by the Executive Board and an ESG   Sustainability Council that meets monthly to drive implementation. The company s materiality assessment identifies key ESG topics including climate change, water stewardship, nutrition, human rights, circular packaging, and employee well-being. Nestlé engages broadly with stakeholders across consumers, governments, suppliers, NGOs, investors, and communities to shape its strategy and actions.
On climate, Nestlé continues to advance its Net Zero Roadmap with targets of a 20  absolute reduction in emissions by 2025, 50  by 2030, and net zero by 2050. The company invested CHF 1.2 billion to support regenerative agricultural practices and landscape restoration initiatives globally. Renewable electricity use at manufacturing sites reached 91.9  in 2023, helping reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by over 33  from 2018 levels. Nestlé acknowledges the risks climate change poses to agricultural yields and supply chain resilience and works proactively on adaptation and mitigation measures including precision agriculture, agroforestry, and diversified sourcing.
In its efforts to protect nature and biodiversity, Nestlé achieved 93.4  assessment of primary supply chains as deforestation-free by the end of 2023 and supports landscape initiatives targeting over 2.5 million hectares of natural ecosystems. Tree planting efforts continue at scale, with over 14.7 million trees secured in 2023 and a commitment to plant 200 million by 2030. Initiatives like the Landscape Enterprise Networks empower groups of farmers to collaborate on biodiversity, soil health, and climate resilience. The company also plays a leadership role in international biodiversity frameworks and industry coalitions.
Nestlé s regenerative agriculture program grew substantially in 2023, reaching 15.2  of key ingredients sourced from farmers adopting regenerative practices, up from 6.8  in 2022, with a goal of 20  by 2025 and 50  by 2030. The approach encourages diverse cropping, biodiversity, landscape-scale actions, soil health, and water stewardship, with widespread training and support for farmers worldwide. Specific case studies include coffee production improvements via the Nescafé Plan 2030, wheat farming initiatives in the United States, and regenerative dairy programs in the UK and Brazil. Advanced farm-level monitoring tools such as the Cool Farm Tool help quantify impacts and support continuous improvement.
Water stewardship is a critical focus area with Nestlé delivering a 3-million-cubic-meter absolute reduction in water use at factories between 2021 and 2023, exceeding its original target of 6 million cubic meters over the same period. Over half of Nestlé Waters sites have been certified to the Alliance for Water Stewardship standard. The company works on watershed health and resilience, implements efficient irrigation techniques such as drip irrigation in Pakistan, and supports community water access projects. Nestlé recognizes water scarcity as both a quantity and quality issue, driving programs to reduce water consumption, improve effluent quality, and engage in water partnerships with global and local stakeholders.
Responsible sourcing covers 36.2  of key ingredients that meet Nestlé s Responsible Sourcing Standard, with commitments to reach 100  by 2030. Cocoa sourcing reached 85.5  through the Nestlé Cocoa Plan, which addresses social and environmental challenges including child labor risks and farmer livelihoods. Palm oil continues to be 100  RSPO certified for crude palm oil. Nestlé s sourcing strategy includes strict traceability, compliance audits, and engagement with suppliers to ensure human rights and environmental standards are met. Progress includes work with hazelnuts in Turkey, coffee across multiple countries, fresh and processed vegetables, and cage-free eggs with a goal for 100  by 2025.
The human rights section highlights the launch of ten Salient Human Rights Issue Action Plans covering child labor, forced labor, living wages, gender equity, health and safety, freedom of association, land rights, data privacy, and the right to food. The company uses multiple risk lenses and data sources to assess risks across countries, suppliers, and raw materials. Child labor monitoring systems cover cocoa and coffee supply chains, reaching over 178,000 children with prevention and remediation support. New governance structures and grievance mechanisms, including the Speak Up channel, enhance oversight and response. Social investments and gender empowerment programs for farming communities are part of a broader human rights framework aligned with UN Guiding Principles and OECD guidelines.
Nestlé s packaging and circularity efforts seek to reduce virgin plastics by one-third by 2025 compared to 2018 and design over 95  of plastic packaging for recycling. In 2023, 83.5  of packaging was designed for recycling, and virgin plastic use was reduced by 14.9 . Innovation includes paperboard substitutes, refillable and reusable packaging pilots, and increasing recycled and renewable content. The company participates in collective initiatives like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation s New Plastics Economy and the Global Plastic Action Partnership, supports waste picker rights through the Fair Circularity Principles, and advances infrastructure and legislation advocacy for better plastic management. It also launched compostable coffee capsules and consumer awareness campaigns.
The nutrition strategy,  Good for You,  focuses on portfolio improvement and communication to help consumers adopt balanced diets. Nestlé set a target to grow sales of nutritious products by CHF 20 25 billion by 2030 and provided 205.8 billion servings of micronutrient-fortified foods in 2023. The company also offers affordable nutrition options, such as plant-based protein blends and fortified cooking ingredients globally. Responsible marketing policies were strengthened to protect children up to 16 years of age, especially limiting advertising of sweetened confectionery and beverages. Efforts to engage with healthcare professionals and culinary experts support nutrition education and innovation.
Food safety and quality remain paramount, with 98.4  of manufacturing sites certified to the FSSC 22000 standard. Over 4.1 million analytical tests ensure safety and compliance across raw materials, production, and products. The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system was revamped to improve risk prevention, supported by digital and AI tools. Investments continue in training employees and suppliers, unannounced audits, and global collaboration with food safety initiatives. Nestlé conducts root cause investigations and corrective actions for any incidents and emphasizes transparent communication and continuous improvement.
Promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is integral to Nestlé s culture and long-term success. By the end of 2023, women held 46.4  of management positions and 25  of Executive Board seats. All markets completed DEI self-assessments and developed action plans. Programs support gender equity, LGBTQI  inclusion, racial and ethnic diversity, disability inclusion, and multi-generational workforce engagement. Training on unconscious bias, sexual harassment prevention, and inclusive leadership is widely completed. The company fosters employee resource groups and supplier diversity initiatives and respects freedom from discrimination, violence, and harassment in line with global standards.
Nestlé actively addresses youth employment, aiming to help 10 million young people gain access to economic opportunities by 2030. The Nestlé needs YOUth initiative celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2023 and operates across three pillars: employment and employability, entrepreneurship, and agripreneurship. Over 7.7 million young people have accessed apprenticeships, training, and entrepreneurial support through this program. Digital platforms such as the Nestlé YOUth Entrepreneurship Platform engage youth globally. Collaborations with UNESCO and other partners advance youth-led innovation and empowerment. The program nurtures future-fit farmers and entrepreneurs to support regenerative food systems.

In 2023, over 260,000 employees were covered by Employee Assistance Programs supporting mental health and well-being, and workers completed an average of 15.1 hours of training. Safety metrics showed a recordable injury rate of 1.17 per million hours worked, with one fatality reported. The company has implemented global health and safety action plans, expanded digital learning, enhanced benefits, and fosters an inclusive, respectful workplace culture. Employee relations emphasize freedom of association, fair dialogue, and competitive compensation.
Ethical business foundations are maintained via a comprehensive Compliance Management System aligned to Nestlé s Corporate Business Principles. The Speak Up grievance mechanism received 2,874 messages in 2023, with 691 substantiated cases leading to corrective actions, including dismissal of employees and termination of service providers.
