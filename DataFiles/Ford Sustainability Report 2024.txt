This is Ford’s 25th annual sustainability report and the first by a U.S. automaker to fully integrate environmental, social, governance, and financial performance into a single consolidated document. The report is aligned with the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). It is structured around a double materiality assessment, capturing both the company’s impact on society and the environment, as well as external impacts on Ford’s financial performance. Previous standalone Human Rights and Climate Change Reports have been integrated. Key sections include Products and Services; Environment; Social; Governance; Data; and Appendices.
Executive Letter & Company Overview
Ford’s mission is to build a better world—equitable, inclusive, and sustainable—where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams. The auto industry is transforming rapidly due to electrification, vehicle digitization, and climate imperatives. In 2023, Ford continued its commitment to internal combustion, hybrid, and electric vehicles. U.S. EV sales rose sharply, hybrid sales increased by 20%, and Ford remained the best-selling truck brand in both EV and traditional segments. Ford Pro, its commercial and government electrification platform, represented a $60 billion business. The expansion of charging access via a wider partnership with Tesla further strengthened EV infrastructure. The Ford+ growth strategy focuses on integrating hardware, software, and services under customer-oriented segments—Ford Blue (ICE/hybrid), Ford Model e (EV), and Ford Pro. Financially, Ford posted revenue of $176.2 billion (up 11 percent), adjusted EBIT of $10.4 billion, and net income of $4.3 billion. Ford issued $4.21 billion in green bonds fully committed to clean transportation and secured over $17 billion in sustainability-linked revolving credit.
Sustainability Leadership & Strategy
Ford’s sustainability strategy tightly weaves climate action, social responsibility, diversity, equitable supply chains, and stakeholder engagement. The company has been recognized for two and a half decades of transparent sustainability reporting and continues to deepen data-driven reporting practices. A refreshed double materiality assessment in 2024 reaffirms its priority topics and aligns reporting with evolving frameworks.
Material Topics
The report identifies four highest‑priority topics: Climate Change (including energy use), Human Rights, Supply Chain Management, and Product Safety and Quality. Other high or moderate impact areas addressed include air, water, and soil pollution; biodiversity and ecosystems; circular economy and end-of-life practices; connected/digital vehicles and data security; human capital and DEI; water resources; business conduct and ethics; customer and community engagement; and employee health and safety.
Sustainability Aspirations & Progress
Ford aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. It follows SBTi‑approved targets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 76 percent by 2035 (from a 2017 baseline), having already delivered a 47 percent reduction. Ford seeks to reduce Scope 3 emissions from vehicle use by 50 percent per kilometer by 2035 (from a 2019 baseline), achieving 6 percent of that goal in 2023. By 2035, all global manufacturing operations are to use carbon‑free electricity; as of 2023, this share stood at 70.5 percent.
In materials and waste, Ford aspires to use only recycled or renewable content in plastics, with targets of 20 percent by 2025 in North America, Europe, and Turkey, and 10 percent in China. The firm already recycles or reuses over 85 percent of vehicle materials at end-of-life. More than 77 percent of sites sent zero waste to landfill in 2023, and total waste to landfill decreased by 8 percent year-on-year to 16,300 metric tons.
Water stewardship goals include eliminating freshwater withdrawals for manufacturing; freshwater use has dropped nearly 19.4 percent from 2019, with more than 199 billion gallons saved since 2000. Ford’s operations in water-scarce regions increasingly use recycled water.
Ford updated its human rights policy to align with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and was ranked first globally by “Lead the Charge” for supply chain sustainability and human rights efforts. The Supplier Code of Conduct was strengthened, and 46 third-party audits were conducted in 2023, adding to over 1,700 since 2003. Risk mapping and auditing now reach mine-site level for EV battery inputs, and programs in the DRC support women and local economic empowerment.
Ford’s safety and quality aspirations aim to eliminate workplace injuries and product crashes; one employee fatality occurred in 2023. Nearly all light vehicles (98%) now include automatic emergency braking; the hands-free driving system BlueCruise was rated #1 by Consumer Reports. Ford scored 5-star NCAP safety ratings in multiple regions and uses software and AI for quality and safety analytics.
DEI and human capital efforts include a global workforce of 174,000, strong union engagement, and labor agreements across major markets. Women represent 28 percent of salaried employees globally and 25.6 percent of top management. The global gender pay ratio stands at 98.7 percent, and in the U.S., minority pay ratio is 101.5 percent. Ten active Employee Resource Groups support diversity, with high engagement and satisfaction scores.
Community investment through Ford Fund and company contributions totaled $73.7 million in 2023, with over $2.3 billion donated since 1949. Employees collectively logged 1.7 million volunteer hours since 2005.
Supply Chain Management
Ford updated its Supplier Code of Conduct to require science-based emissions targets, Indigenous Peoples’ free, prior, and informed consent, living wages, and zero tolerance for child or forced labor. Ford is the first U.S. automaker participating in IRMA (Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance). Data platforms Catena‑X and Cofinity X enhance raw material traceability. The company committed to sourcing at least 10 percent low‑carbon aluminum and near‑zero steel by 2030 via the First Movers Coalition. Battery recycling infrastructure, plant-based material use, closed-loop aluminum recycling, and remanufacturing of 119,000 engines or transmissions support circularity.
Governance, Reporting & Stakeholder Dialogue
ESG oversight is provided by the Board’s Sustainability, Innovation & Policy Committee, and executive performance is tied to sustainability outcomes. Reporting draws on CSRD, GRI, SASB, TCFD, UNGP, and SDG frameworks. The double materiality assessment is refreshed annually. Ford engages stakeholders continuously—investors, employees, suppliers, customers, communities, NGOs—through channels like the Blue Table Forum, which convenes over ninety organizations.
Environmental Focus
Comprehensive emissions reporting spans Scopes 1, 2, and 3, including product-use emissions. The EV strategy is central to decarbonization, complemented by enhancements in ICE and hybrid models for transition markets. Regional adaptation ensures compliance with ZEV mandates in Europe and California. Advanced practices are in place for water and waste management, including 86 zero-waste-to-landfill sites globally. Ford supports biodiversity through conservation easements (e.g. Kalamazoo River), the Ford Wildlife Foundation, and a $6.4 million Bronze Wild Fund. Efforts to replace hazardous chemicals underlie proactive risk mitigation.
Social Focus
Human rights risk assessments and mapping include climate-related risks, labor conditions, EV transition impacts, Indigenous rights, and harassment/discrimination. Supply chain due diligence includes audits, grievance mechanisms like SpeakUp and Worker Voice, and corrective action plans. Training and reskilling efforts support just transition; hybrid and flexible work policies and progressive benefits address diverse employee needs. Supplier diversity is long-standing and includes support for businesses owned by minorities, women, veterans, LGBTQ+, and disabled entrepreneurs.
Data, Digital, Cyber & Innovation
Ford invested $8.9 billion in engineering and R&D in 2023. Over-the-air updates and AI analytics power predictive maintenance, safety, quality, and digital vehicle experiences. Platforms integrate Google, Alexa, CarPlay, Android Auto, and OTA upgrades. Cybersecurity and data privacy follow industry best practices, with active involvement in AutoISAC and National Charging Consortium. AI adoption is guided responsibly in collaboration with the Responsible AI Institute.
Risk, Opportunity & Scenario Strategy
The company conducts TCFD-aligned scenario analyses across net-zero, stated-policy, and high-emissions (RCP8.5) pathways. Transition and physical risks—regulatory, supply chain, resource scarcity, extreme weather, reputation—are mapped. Flexibility in its product and powertrain portfolio is seen as a critical strategic advantage. Policy engagement includes support for federal and state climate standards and ZEV regulations.
