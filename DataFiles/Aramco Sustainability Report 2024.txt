This is Aramco’s fourth annual Sustainability Report, detailing performance for the year 2024. The report covers Aramco’s wholly owned and operated assets unless otherwise noted, and excludes its main listed affiliates, such as Sadara, SABIC, S-Oil, and Luberef. It is prepared with reference to Ipieca Guidelines, the GHG Protocol, OSHA/API metrics, and other international standards. Many of the key metrics presented are externally assured under the ISAE 3000 standard, with assurance status noted throughout the document. The data largely reflect performance during the full 2024 calendar year. The report is structured around four primary focus areas: Climate change and the energy transition, Safe operations and people development, Minimizing environmental impact, and Growing societal value.
Aramco is one of the world’s largest integrated energy and chemicals companies, operating in over 50 countries. In 2024, it employed 75,118 individuals from 94 different nationalities. The company’s hydrocarbons production reached 12.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. It reported a net refining capacity of 4.1 million barrels per day and a net chemicals production capacity of 57.6 million metric tons per annum. In 2024, Aramco’s capital expenditure amounted to $50 billion, while its net income reached $106 billion and dividends paid totaled $127 billion. Payments to governments through taxes, royalties, and dividends totaled $204 billion. Its in-Kingdom Total Value Add (iktva) procurement spend was 67 percent. Aramco invested $583 million in social initiatives and, since 2015, has contributed $240 billion to cumulative iktva GDP. Over 90 percent of its in-Kingdom workforce is Saudi, with 5.8 percent in female leadership positions.
The sustainability framework centers on four key areas: Climate change and the energy transition, Safe operations and people development, Minimizing environmental impact, and Growing societal value. The company has identified 13 material sustainability topics, supported by overarching corporate governance. These material topics are reassessed annually through stakeholder engagement, benchmarking, and reviews of evolving global standards. ESG governance is embedded throughout the organization, from board level to operations. A dedicated Board-level Sustainability, Risk & HSE Committee oversees strategy, risk, and key metrics.
Under the first focus area, Aramco has set an ambition to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from its wholly owned and operated assets by 2050. It has an interim upstream carbon intensity target of no more than 8.6 kilograms CO2e per barrel of oil equivalent by 2030, and a 15 percent reduction by 2035 compared to a 2018 baseline. Its decarbonization roadmap involves five primary levers: energy efficiency, flaring and methane reduction, carbon capture and storage, renewable energy integration, and natural climate solutions including offsets.
In 2024, Aramco reported Scope 1 emissions of 56.1 million metric tons CO2e, an increase of 3.1 percent from 2023, mainly due to expanded gas operations. Scope 2 emissions (market-based) were 12.4 million metric tons CO2e, a decrease of 4.6 percent. Upstream carbon intensity (market-based) was 9.7 kilograms CO2e per barrel of oil equivalent, a 1.0 percent increase. Methane emissions dropped by 11.4 percent to 24,548 metric tons CH4, with a methane intensity of 0.04 percent, placing Aramco among OGCI leaders. Flaring intensity increased by 7.6 percent to 6.07 standard cubic feet per barrel of oil equivalent, with total flared gas amounting to 28,846 million standard cubic feet. Total energy consumption was 88,091 MMBtu per hour, with an energy intensity of 162.9 thousand Btu per barrel of oil equivalent.
Aramco implemented 101 energy efficiency initiatives that saved 1,243 MMBtu per hour and avoided 0.57 million metric tons of CO2e in 2024. It is a signatory to the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. Advanced technologies such as AI-driven operations, flare gas recovery, and pipeline isolation are helping improve flaring performance. Methane reduction efforts include satellite monitoring via GHGSat, optical gas imaging surveys, advanced leak detection tools, and a digital dashboard. For carbon capture and storage, Aramco is developing a CCS hub in Jubail in partnership with Linde and SLB, with commissioning expected by 2028 and a planned capacity of 9 million metric tons per annum. Multiple mineralization pilot projects are also underway. In renewables, Aramco operates 4.2 GWac of solar power and has 5.5 GWac under development. Renewable energy certificates help reduce Scope 2 emissions. Aramco planted 12.5 million mangroves in 2024 and has a target of 300 million by 2035. It procured 1.1 million carbon credits and retired 0.51 million metric tons CO2e as verified offsets. Five carbon-neutral crude shipments were verified in 2024, with an average intensity of 7.48 kg CO2e per barrel of oil equivalent. Aramco acquired a 50 percent stake in Jubail Blue Hydrogen and is pursuing phased blue ammonia development targeting 2.5 million metric tons per annum by 2030, scalable to 11 million metric tons depending on demand. Sustainability-related R&D spending totaled $623 million, accounting for 63 percent of Aramco’s total R&D, and 26 percent of its 2024 patents were climate- or sustainability-related.
Under Safe operations and people development, Aramco reported eight fatalities (two employees and six contractors), each incident fully investigated and followed by remedial actions. There were nine Tier 1 process safety events, a 40 percent reduction from the previous year. The Lost Time Injury/Illness Rate was 0.021 per 200,000 hours and the Total Recordable Case Rate was 0.046. Safety systems include ISO 45001-aligned management systems and a digital SafeLife platform. The company uses various safety indices to track contractor performance and runs a real-time HSE Intelligence Hub. Aramco’s workforce represented 94 nationalities, with women accounting for 7.9 percent of total employees and 5.8 percent of leadership. Employees averaged 140 training hours in 2024, with 13.8 million total hours, 3,222 interns, 1,124 graduate hires, and 1,986 apprentices. The employee experience index scored 88 percent in bi-annual surveys, and attrition was 2.8 percent. Equity and inclusion programs aim to increase representation of persons with disabilities and women. Twenty-four percent of new hires were female. Aramco also maintains comprehensive well-being support, including mental health platforms, 24/7 counseling, and contractor wellness initiatives that have enrolled over 100,000 participants. A total of 112 workplace grievances were recorded and addressed across fully covered sites.
